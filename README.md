This blog was created with Jekyll theme **Chirpy** which can be found here [jekyll-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

### Things yet to do to make me happier with this blog:
- [ ] enable comments under posts
- [ ] add baseurl so site would have path "... github.io/between-java-and-python"
- [ ] create avatar icon in two versions: negative space, positive space
- [ ] set negative space icon as default instead of none present now
- [ ] create blog description in _config.yml to fit seo rules
- [ ] create about.md to have some basic description about the author
- [ ] find a way to put logic with changing avatar space while changing mode display on the blog
- [ ] find a way to add CV somewhere

#### Ideas for the future:
- [ ] add one more category in the sidebar - projects
